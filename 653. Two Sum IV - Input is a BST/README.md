# 653. Two Sum IV - Input is a BST

Easy

Given the `root` of a binary search tree and an integer `k`, return `true` if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to `k`, or `false` otherwise.

 

**Example 1:**

![sumtree1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/21/sum_tree_1.jpg)
```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 9
Output: true
```
**Example 2:**

![sumtree2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/21/sum_tree_2.jpg)
```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 28
Output: false
 ```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, $10^4$].
- -$10^4$ <= Node.val <= $10^4$
- `root` is guaranteed to be a **valid** binary search tree.
- -$10^5$ <= k <= $10^5$
